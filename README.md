# minesweeper-java



Welcome to my Java Minesweeper project! This program creates a 10x10 Minesweeper game with 10 mines and using the clues from the number of neighbouring mines of each cell, you have to locate the 10!



You can edit the number of mines and the size of the grid within the App class by changing the variable in the line:

Game game = new Game(10, 10, 10);

to Game game = new Game(rows in grid, columns in grid, number of mines);



Thank you for playing!
